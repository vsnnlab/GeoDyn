1. System requirements
MATLAB 2021a or later version
No non-standard hardware is required.
Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2021a.

2. Preparation of data
Due to the size of brain imaging file, the VSDI data used in paper is not provided in here.
You should prepare your personal data for classification.
Please add the path of functions folder before run the codes

3. Instructions for execution
The code is basically structured as 1) analysis and 2)drawing figure part.
Execute the codes in anaysis folder step by step.
the anaylsis folder includes the proceedure of filtering data, generate geodyn profiles and classification
Then, execute the files in draw_figure to generating figures in paper
